# FitQuest
## Description
### Inspiration
•⁠  ⁠We noticed a big problem that had a simple solution. 
•⁠  ⁠Physical inactivity in the US adult population leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity which costs taxpayers about 117 Billion dollars annually. 
•⁠  ⁠The CDC recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week to counter this, but with today's sedentary lifestyle, it is difficult to find the time and motivation. 
•⁠  ⁠Fitquest, our gamified app makes exercise fun, connects you with friends and incorporates more activity into your daily routine.
